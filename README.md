# Sprite Chat

Sprite Chat is an Airtable Block that will bring your chat room to life in a 2D interactive world. As a user, you can move around as a Sprite of your choice and engage in lively discussions with your peers.

## Getting Started

To get your own block up and running, you will need to first create your own Airtable account and create a new base with a Table named "Chat Log". This table should have three Columns - "Message" (Long Text Type), "UserName" (Created by Type), and "TimeStamp" (Created time Type). 

Then Follow the instructions listed [here](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/run-in-multiple-bases)
