# Sprite Chat

Sprite Chat is an Airtable Block that will bring your chat room to life in a 2D interactive world. As a user, you can move around as a Sprite of your choice and engage in lively discussions with your peers.

## Getting Started

To use the Sprite Chat block, ensure that your base has a table called 'Chat Log' , with the following 3 fields:
- UserName (collaborator field)
- Message (text field)
- TimeStamp (datetime field)

Make sure the capitalization is correct for each!

Then Follow the instructions listed [here](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/run-in-multiple-bases)
